## NODE ROBOTS PROJECT

Here is a project that I have developed based upon a project made and explained by [Filipe Deschamps](https://github.com/filipedeschamps/video-maker.git). It dives into Node.js and uses APIs from *Google* (Custom Search API and YouTube) and *IBM* (Watson - Natural Language Understanding). Also, it uses *Express.JS* framework and *OAuth2* authentication.
